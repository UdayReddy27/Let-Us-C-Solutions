 (a)  the initialization expression.
       the testing expression.
       the increasing/decreasing expression.
  
 (b)  a for loop.
  
 (c)  At least once.
 
 (d)  Initialization, execution of body, testing.
 
 (e)  3.
 
 (f)  Continue;
 
 (g)  Infinite times.
 
 (h)  The program will produce the output x = 10 y = 10.
       The ; after the if (x != y) would NOT produce an error.

 (i)  All things that can be done using a for loop can also be done using a while loop.
       for(; ;) implements an infinite loop.
